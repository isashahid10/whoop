// headless_gate.dart — ONE process-wide gate for every headless sync entry point.
//
// Three separate wake paths can call runHeadlessSync():
//   - the iOS CoreBluetooth-restoration wake (IosBleRestore)
//   - the iOS BGProcessingTask (IosBgTask, heavy profile)
//   - the iOS BGAppRefreshTask (IosBgTask, sync-only profile)
//
// They used to carry their OWN private `_busy` flags with asymmetric guards, so
// two of them could race into runHeadlessSync() concurrently and only the
// engine's static band-owner arbitration saved the offload from duplicate ACKs.
// This gate makes the mutual exclusion EXPLICIT and shared: whichever entry
// point is running holds the gate; the others skip their cycle (a skipped wake
// is harmless — the non-destructive cursor catches everything up next time).
