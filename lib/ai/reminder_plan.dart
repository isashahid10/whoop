// reminder_plan.dart — PURE policy: which AI-feature notifications should be
// on the OS schedule right now, and when. NotificationCenter executes this
// plan; nothing here touches the plugin, so the whole surface is unit-testable.
//
// Design constraint (iOS): BYOK network can't run reliably in the background,
// so the scheduled briefing notifications are LIGHT prompts ("ready — tap to
// view") that deep-link into the breakdown screen, which generates-or-shows-
// cached on open. Generation also happens opportunistically on foreground.
