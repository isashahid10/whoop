# Openstrap Edge

An app that makes a WHOOP 4.0 useful without a WHOOP subscription. Connects to the band over Bluetooth, computes everything on your phone locally iOS and Android.

## Install

| | |
|---|---|
| **iOS** | **[Join the TestFlight beta →](https://testflight.apple.com/join/2BVSwq65)** — normal TestFlight install, no sideloading, no computer needed. |
| **Android** | **[Download the APK →](https://github.com/OpenStrap/edge/releases/latest)** — allow installs from unknown sources and open it. |

Quit the official WHOOP app before you pair. Bluetooth only lets one app own the
band at a time.

Prefer to sideload the unsigned IPA instead of using TestFlight? That still
works — see [`guides/IOS_SIDELOAD.md`](guides/IOS_SIDELOAD.md).

## What made me build this app 

My subscription lapsed and a perfectly good sensor turned into a bracelet. The hardware
never stopped working, only the app that made it useful did. So I reverse-engineered
enough of the band's Bluetooth protocol to talk to it myself, wrote the analytics from
scratch off published research instead of guessing at WHOOP's formulas, and built an app
around the result. Now it works without them, and anyone else stuck with the same
drawer-bracelet problem can use it, or go dig through the code themselves.

## Checklist

- **WHOOP 4.0 only.** Haven't touched a WHOOP 5, don't know if it even shares a protocol.
- Not affiliated with WHOOP, doesn't talk to their servers.
- Not a clone of their algorithms — different math, published methods, cited in the
  analytics repo. Don't expect identical numbers to what their app shows.
- There are bugs. Some I know about, more I probably don't. Open an issue if something
  looks wrong.
- **Don't bounce between this and the official WHOOP app.** A firmware push from their
  app could change the records this one depends on, and there's no fixing that from here.
  Pick one and stay on it.

iOS also gets a home-screen widget, a lock-screen/Dynamic Island Live Activity, and a
couple of Siri shortcuts.

## What works

**Health** — heart rate, HRV, sleep staging, recovery/readiness, strain, stress, an HRV
spot-check, real-time breathing coherence.

**Activity** — auto-detected workouts, live workout tracking with GPS routes, heart-rate
zones.

**Your data, elsewhere** — writes to **Apple Health** (HealthKit) and **Google Health
Connect**: sleep stages, resting HR, HRV, respiratory rate, active energy and workouts.
Only things the band actually measures — never the derived scores, which have no native
type and would be fabricated. Exports are idempotent, so a day re-deriving never
duplicates samples. You can also export the entire local SQLite database to a file
whenever you like — it's your data, in a format anything can open.

**Background sync** — the band drains without you opening the app. Android runs a
foreground service with a 15-minute watchdog worker and re-attaches via
CompanionDeviceManager. iOS uses a background processing task plus a light refresh task,
and a separate restore Bluetooth central that relaunches the app when the band
reconnects.

**Everything else** — trends/history, a journal with on-device correlation insights
("what actually moves your numbers"), cycle tracking, a deterministic coach, a shareable
weekly recap, a BYOK AI assistant, home-screen widgets, iOS Live Activities, Siri
shortcuts, a smart alarm that buzzes the band.

## What doesn't work (yet, or maybe ever)

- iOS background sync is best-effort. It genuinely works (see above), but Apple doesn't
  give third-party apps a real background-service option, so the OS decides when those
  tasks actually run. Syncing while you haven't opened the app in a while is "usually,"
  not "always." Android has no such limit.
- Metrics are approximations off published research — not medical-grade, not validated
  against a lab, don't treat any of it as a diagnosis.
- Not on the App Store or Play Store yet. iOS is a public TestFlight beta, which is a
  normal install but still a beta; Android is an APK straight off Releases.
- WHOOP 5.0 / MG support is in progress and **experimental** — the band is detected and
  spoken to, but it hasn't been validated against real 5.0 hardware. WHOOP 4.0 is the
  only one that's actually tested.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenStrap/edge.git
cd edge
cp .env.example .env
flutter pub get
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env
```

Quit the official WHOOP app before you pair — Bluetooth only lets one app own the band at
a time. iOS signing and the App Group setup for the widget/Live Activity is its own
longer story — see `guides/IOS_INSTALLATION.md`.

## How it works

```
WHOOP band → Bluetooth → protocol decoder → local storage → analytics → the UI
```

- `openstrap_protocol` turns bytes off the band into records.
- `openstrap_analytics` turns those records into metrics, each with its own confidence
  score attached — nothing gets faked when the data isn't there.
- this repo is the glue: Bluetooth reliability, local storage (versioned, so an algorithm
  update never silently overwrites old results), background sync, the UI.
- everything that matters stays on the phone.

## Complex Bluetooth protocol

The band doesn't have a normal documented API — it's a proprietary protocol, and getting
it to behave reliably took a while. Short version: the clock ships unset (skip setting it
and every timestamp comes out garbage), history comes off in batches that need an exact
8-byte token echoed back or the band just re-sends the same data forever, and the local
save has to happen before that acknowledgement goes out, not after, so a crash mid-sync
can't lose anything.

The full blow-by-blow lives in the [protocol repo's
README](https://github.com/OpenStrap/protocol) — genuinely the more interesting read if
you're into this kind of thing.

## Your data stays on your phone

Everything's computed and stored locally. No cloud account required, no backend this
needs to work day to day. **Your health data never leaves the device unless you
explicitly send it somewhere.**

Being precise about the network, since "no cloud" gets said too loosely. Nothing below
is required for the app to work, and none of it carries health data except the two you
turn on yourself:

- **Anonymous diagnostics** (Firebase crash/performance). **On by default in GitHub
  release builds** — switch it off in your profile and collection stops immediately.
  **Not present at all** in App Store / Play Store builds. Never includes health data.
- **OTA/announcement pointer** — checks whether there's a newer build.
- **Legacy account import** — one-time, only if you had an old OpenStrap cloud account.
- **BYOK AI assistant** — only if you configure a provider; your key, your account,
  prompts go to whoever you chose.
- **Health-data contribution** — opt-in, off by default, GitHub builds only. This one
  does upload your local database, which is the entire point of it, and it's the only
  thing here that does.

## Repo layout

```
lib/ble/       Bluetooth + sync
lib/data/      local storage + the repository seam the UI reads from
lib/compute/   runs the analytics pipeline, writes results
lib/state/     AppState, the one source of truth
lib/ui/        every screen
```

Protocol decoding and analytics live in their own repos —
[protocol](https://github.com/OpenStrap/protocol),
[analytics](https://github.com/OpenStrap/analytics).

## Contributing

Found something broken? Open an issue. Found something broken and fixed it? Even better,
send the PR. Protocol-level stuff (new record types, opcodes) belongs in the protocol
repo, metric/formula changes belong in analytics, anything about the app itself —
Bluetooth, storage, UI — belongs here.

[**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the details: which repo a change belongs in,
how to run the three packages together locally, and the two rules that matter most —
never fabricate a number when the data isn't there, and cite the published method you're
implementing.

Security problems shouldn't go in a public issue — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for
private reporting.

## Support the work

Free, MIT, no company behind it. If it gave your band a second life:
[**DONATE.md**](DONATE.md) has BTC and EVM addresses. Bug reports from real bands are
worth more than money, though — there's only one person's physiology in the test data
otherwise.
